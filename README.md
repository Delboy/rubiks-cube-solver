# Rubik's Cube Solver

Rubik's Cube Solver is a website that helps beginners through the steps of solving, you guessed it, A Rubiks Cube! I created this site using [React.](https://reactjs.org/)

## User Experience (UX)

A visitor to Rubiks Cube Solver would be someone who is interested in learning how to solve a rubiks cube, or just to practice their skills.

## User Stories

A list of my user stories and their tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Delboy/projects/1).

### As a user:
- I can easily change each segment's colour so that I can match my own cube.
- I can toggle tips on and off so I can practice with or without help.
- I want to understand the controls intuitively so that I can play the game without problems.
- I can rotate the cube so that I can view every side.
- I can rotate a layer so that I can re-arrange the cube.
- I can reset all colours so that I can start again from scratch.
- I can shuffle the colours so that I can try to solve a random cube.
- I can see how many moves Iâ€™ve committed so I can keep track of my personal best.
- I can see notation of  my last move so that I can keep track of the moves I've made .
- I can keep my progress incase I refresh the page.
- I can save my progress so I can come back at a later time to finish the game/tutorial.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted the colours of the cube to be easy on the eye and almost look like it was hand drawn, so therefore I went with a pastel colour scheme.
